### Part 1

- Given the javascript object containing event data, built a page that displays a list of events for one artist.
- Update the design to show the user all the important information that a customer would want to know when deciding on which event to go to.

### My Response(Part 1)

- i was able to parse the given json file and work with it throughout the project.i used information that was relevant for users based on the json file provided.

### Part 2

- Design and implement a filter that will allow users to filter by location. The filter should have a full list of locations where all locations are visible and allows the user to select a location.

### My Response(Part 2)

- using location, i was able to use it to get all the relevant informations users would need to know about Elton Johns tour dates.

### Part 3

- Imagine that based on the information we collected about how users interact with our page, we found that the filter was not well received by our users. We still believe that having a filter is a great feature for them, so:

  - Tell us about the possible reasons that the filter your implemented in part 2 did not help the customer experience.
  - What could you change to improve the filter experience, and why do you think it would be better for the customer?

  ### My Response(Part 3)

  -Using location alone was too broad of a search filter. Using pricing, and start and end dates help narrow the search for what users would like to find. Doing this will cut down on time for users to search for what they are looking for. I was able to apply location and pricing for my ViaEltonGo application, along with displaying more detailed information about the ticket once selected.
